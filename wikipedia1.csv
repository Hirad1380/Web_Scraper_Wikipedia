2,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#bodyContent,A car  or an automobile  is a motor vehicle with wheels. Most definitions of cars state that they run primarily on roads  seat one to eight people  have four wheels  and mainly transport people  not cargo.[1][2]
3,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#bodyContent,The French inventor Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot built the first steam-powered road vehicle in 1769  while the Swiss inventor François Isaac de Rivaz designed and constructed the first internal combustion-powered automobile in 1808. The modern car—a practical  marketable automobile for everyday use—was invented in 1886  when the German inventor Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Commercial cars became widely available during the 20th century. One of the first cars affordable by the masses was the Ford Model T  begun in 1908  an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US  where they replaced horse-drawn carriages.[3] In Europe and other parts of the world  demand for automobiles did not increase until after World War II.[4] The car is considered an essential part of the developed economy.
4,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#bodyContent,Cars have controls for driving  parking  passenger comfort  and a variety of lamps. Over the decades  additional features and controls have been added to vehicles  making them progressively more complex. These include rear-reversing cameras  air conditioning  navigation systems  and in-car entertainment. Most cars in use in the early 2020s are propelled by an internal combustion engine  fueled by the combustion of fossil fuels. Electric cars  which were invented early in the history of the car  became commercially available in the 2000s and are predicted to cost less to buy than petrol-driven cars before 2025.[5][6] The transition from fossil fuel-powered cars to electric cars features prominently in most climate change mitigation scenarios [7] such as Project Drawdown's 100 actionable solutions for climate change.[8]
5,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#bodyContent,There are costs and benefits to car use. The costs to the individual include acquiring the vehicle  interest payments (if the car is financed)  repairs and maintenance  fuel  depreciation  driving time  parking fees  taxes  and insurance.[9] The costs to society include maintaining roads  land-use  road congestion  air pollution  noise pollution  public health  and disposing of the vehicle at the end of its life. Traffic collisions are the largest cause of injury-related deaths worldwide.[10] Personal benefits include on-demand transportation  mobility  independence  and convenience.[11] Societal benefits include economic benefits  such as job and wealth creation from the automotive industry  transportation provision  societal well-being from leisure and travel opportunities  and the generation of revenue from taxation. People's ability to move flexibly from place to place has far-reaching implications for the nature of societies.[12] There are around one billion cars in use worldwide. Car usage is increasing rapidly  especially in China  India  and other newly industrialised countries.[13]
6,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#bodyContent,The English word car is believed to originate from Latin carrus/carrum wheeled vehicle or (via Old North French) Middle English carre two-wheeled cart  both of which in turn derive from Gaulish karros chariot.[14][15] It originally referred to any wheeled horse-drawn vehicle  such as a cart  carriage  or wagon.[16][17]
7,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#bodyContent,Motor car  attested from 1895  is the usual formal term in British English.[2] Autocar  a variant likewise attested from 1895 and literally meaning self-propelled car  is now considered archaic.[18] Horseless carriage is attested from 1895.[19]
8,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#bodyContent,Automobile  a classical compound derived from Ancient Greek autós (αὐτός) self and Latin mobilis movable  entered English from French and was first adopted by the Automobile Club of Great Britain in 1897.[20] It fell out of favour in Britain and is now used chiefly in North America [21] where the abbreviated form auto commonly appears as an adjective in compound formations like auto industry and auto mechanic.[22][23]
9,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#bodyContent,The first steam-powered vehicle was designed by Ferdinand Verbiest  a Flemish member of a Jesuit mission in China around 1672. It was a 65-centimetre-long (26 in) scale-model toy for the Kangxi Emperor that was unable to carry a driver or a passenger.[11][26][27] It is not known with certainty if Verbiest's model was successfully built or run.[27]
10,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#bodyContent,Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot is widely credited with building the first full-scale  self-propelled mechanical vehicle in about 1769; he created a steam-powered tricycle.[28] He also constructed two steam tractors for the French Army  one of which is preserved in the French National Conservatory of Arts and Crafts.[28] His inventions were limited by problems with water supply and maintaining steam pressure.[28] In 1801  Richard Trevithick built and demonstrated his Puffing Devil road locomotive  believed by many to be the first demonstration of a steam-powered road vehicle. It was unable to maintain sufficient steam pressure for long periods and was of little practical use.
11,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#bodyContent,The development of external combustion (steam) engines is detailed as part of the history of the car but often treated separately from the development of true cars. A variety of steam-powered road vehicles were used during the first part of the 19th century  including steam cars  steam buses  phaetons  and steam rollers. In the United Kingdom  sentiment against them led to the Locomotive Acts of 1865.
12,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#bodyContent,In 1807  Nicéphore Niépce and his brother Claude created what was probably the world's first internal combustion engine (which they called a Pyréolophore)  but installed it in a boat on the river Saone in France.[29] Coincidentally  in 1807  the Swiss inventor François Isaac de Rivaz designed his own de Rivaz internal combustion engine  and used it to develop the world's first vehicle to be powered by such an engine. The Niépces' Pyréolophore was fuelled by a mixture of Lycopodium powder (dried spores of the Lycopodium plant)  finely crushed coal dust and resin that were mixed with oil  whereas de Rivaz used a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen.[29] Neither design was successful  as was the case with others  such as Samuel Brown  Samuel Morey  and Etienne Lenoir [30] who each built vehicles (usually adapted carriages or carts) powered by internal combustion engines.[31]
13,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#bodyContent,In November 1881  French inventor Gustave Trouvé demonstrated a three-wheeled car powered by electricity at the International Exposition of Electricity.[32] Although several other German engineers (including Gottlieb Daimler  Wilhelm Maybach  and Siegfried Marcus) were working on cars at about the same time  the year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the modern car—a practical  marketable automobile for everyday use—when the German Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen; he is generally acknowledged as the inventor of the car.[31][33][34]
14,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#bodyContent,In 1879  Benz was granted a patent for his first engine  which had been designed in 1878. Many of his other inventions made the use of the internal combustion engine feasible for powering a vehicle. His first Motorwagen was built in 1885 in Mannheim  Germany. He was awarded the patent for its invention as of his application on 29 January 1886 (under the auspices of his major company  Benz & Cie.  which was founded in 1883). Benz began promotion of the vehicle on 3 July 1886  and about 25 Benz vehicles were sold between 1888 and 1893  when his first four-wheeler was introduced along with a cheaper model. They also were powered with four-stroke engines of his own design. Emile Roger of France  already producing Benz engines under license  now added the Benz car to his line of products. Because France was more open to the early cars  initially more were built and sold in France through Roger than Benz sold in Germany. In August 1888  Bertha Benz  the wife of Carl Benz  undertook the first road trip by car  to prove the road-worthiness of her husband's invention.
15,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#bodyContent,In 1896  Benz designed and patented the first internal-combustion flat engine  called boxermotor. During the last years of the 19th century  Benz was the largest car company in the world with 572 units produced in 1899 and  because of its size  Benz & Cie.  became a joint-stock company. The first motor car in central Europe and one of the first factory-made cars in the world  was produced by Czech company Nesselsdorfer Wagenbau (later renamed to Tatra) in 1897  the Präsident automobil.
16,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#bodyContent,Daimler and Maybach founded Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft (DMG) in Cannstatt in 1890  and sold their first car in 1892 under the brand name Daimler. It was a horse-drawn stagecoach built by another manufacturer  which they retrofitted with an engine of their design. By 1895  about 30 vehicles had been built by Daimler and Maybach  either at the Daimler works or in the Hotel Hermann  where they set up shop after disputes with their backers. Benz  Maybach  and the Daimler team seem to have been unaware of each other's early work. They never worked together; by the time of the merger of the two companies  Daimler and Maybach were no longer part of DMG. Daimler died in 1900 and later that year  Maybach designed an engine named Daimler-Mercedes that was placed in a specially ordered model built to specifications set by Emil Jellinek. This was a production of a small number of vehicles for Jellinek to race and market in his country. Two years later  in 1902  a new model DMG car was produced and the model was named Mercedes after the Maybach engine  which generated 35 hp. Maybach quit DMG shortly thereafter and opened a business of his own. Rights to the Daimler brand name were sold to other manufacturers.
17,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#bodyContent,In 1890  Émile Levassor and Armand Peugeot of France began producing vehicles with Daimler engines  and so laid the foundation of the automotive industry in France. In 1891  Auguste Doriot and his Peugeot colleague Louis Rigoulot completed the longest trip by a petrol-driven vehicle when their self-designed and built Daimler powered Peugeot Type 3 completed 2 100 kilometres (1 300 mi) from Valentigney to Paris and Brest and back again. They were attached to the first Paris–Brest–Paris bicycle race  but finished six days after the winning cyclist  Charles Terront.
18,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#bodyContent,The first design for an American car with a petrol internal combustion engine was made in 1877 by George Selden of Rochester  New York. Selden applied for a patent for a car in 1879  but the patent application expired because the vehicle was never built. After a delay of 16 years and a series of attachments to his application  on 5 November 1895  Selden was granted a US patent (U.S. patent 549 160) for a two-stroke car engine  which hindered  more than encouraged  development of cars in the United States. His patent was challenged by Henry Ford and others  and overturned in 1911.
19,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#bodyContent,In 1893  the first running  petrol-driven American car was built and road-tested by the Duryea brothers of Springfield  Massachusetts. The first public run of the Duryea Motor Wagon took place on 21 September 1893  on Taylor Street in Metro Center Springfield.[35][36] Studebaker  subsidiary of a long-established wagon and coach manufacturer  started to build cars in 1897[37]: 66  and commenced sales of electric vehicles in 1902 and petrol vehicles in 1904.[38]
20,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#bodyContent,In Britain  there had been several attempts to build steam cars with varying degrees of success  with Thomas Rickett even attempting a production run in 1860.[39] Santler from Malvern is recognised by the Veteran Car Club of Great Britain as having made the first petrol-driven car in the country in 1894 [40] followed by Frederick William Lanchester in 1895  but these were both one-offs.[40] The first production vehicles in Great Britain came from the Daimler Company  a company founded by Harry J. Lawson in 1896  after purchasing the right to use the name of the engines. Lawson's company made its first car in 1897  and they bore the name Daimler.[40]
21,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#bodyContent,In 1892  German engineer Rudolf Diesel was granted a patent for a New Rational Combustion Engine. In 1897  he built the first diesel engine.[31] Steam-  electric-  and petrol-driven vehicles competed for a few decades  with petrol internal combustion engines achieving dominance in the 1910s. Although various pistonless rotary engine designs have attempted to compete with the conventional piston and crankshaft design  only Mazda's version of the Wankel engine has had more than very limited success.
22,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#bodyContent,All in all  it is estimated that over 100 000 patents created the modern automobile and motorcycle.[41]
23,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#bodyContent,Large-scale  production-line manufacturing of affordable cars was started by Ransom Olds in 1901 at his Oldsmobile factory in Lansing  Michigan  and based upon stationary assembly line techniques pioneered by Marc Isambard Brunel at the Portsmouth Block Mills  England  in 1802. The assembly line style of mass production and interchangeable parts had been pioneered in the US by Thomas Blanchard in 1821  at the Springfield Armory in Springfield  Massachusetts.[42] This concept was greatly expanded by Henry Ford  beginning in 1913 with the world's first moving assembly line for cars at the Highland Park Ford Plant.
24,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#bodyContent,As a result  Ford's cars came off the line in 15-minute intervals  much faster than previous methods  increasing productivity eightfold  while using less manpower (from 12.5 manhours to 1 hour 33 minutes).[43] It was so successful  paint became a bottleneck. Only Japan black would dry fast enough  forcing the company to drop the variety of colours available before 1913  until fast-drying Duco lacquer was developed in 1926. This is the source of Ford's apocryphal remark  any color as long as it's black.[43] In 1914  an assembly line worker could buy a Model T with four months' pay.[43]
25,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#bodyContent,Ford's complex safety procedures—especially assigning each worker to a specific location instead of allowing them to roam about—dramatically reduced the rate of injury.[44] The combination of high wages and high efficiency is called Fordism and was copied by most major industries. The efficiency gains from the assembly line also coincided with the economic rise of the US. The assembly line forced workers to work at a certain pace with very repetitive motions which led to more output per worker while other countries were using less productive methods.
26,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#bodyContent,In the automotive industry  its success was dominating  and quickly spread worldwide seeing the founding of Ford France and Ford Britain in 1911  Ford Denmark 1923  Ford Germany 1925; in 1921  Citroën was the first native European manufacturer to adopt the production method. Soon  companies had to have assembly lines  or risk going broke; by 1930  250 companies which did not  had disappeared.[43]
27,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#bodyContent,Development of automotive technology was rapid  due in part to the hundreds of small manufacturers competing to gain the world's attention. Key developments included electric ignition and the electric self-starter (both by Charles Kettering  for the Cadillac Motor Company in 1910–1911)  independent suspension  and four-wheel brakes.
28,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#bodyContent,Since the 1920s  nearly all cars have been mass-produced to meet market needs  so marketing plans often have heavily influenced car design. It was Alfred P. Sloan who established the idea of different makes of cars produced by one company  called the General Motors Companion Make Program  so that buyers could move up as their fortunes improved.
29,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#bodyContent,Reflecting the rapid pace of change  makes shared parts with one another so larger production volume resulted in lower costs for each price range. For example  in the 1930s  LaSalles  sold by Cadillac  used cheaper mechanical parts made by Oldsmobile; in the 1950s  Chevrolet shared bonnet  doors  roof  and windows with Pontiac; by the 1990s  corporate powertrains and shared platforms (with interchangeable brakes  suspension  and other parts) were common. Even so  only major makers could afford high costs  and even companies with decades of production  such as Apperson  Cole  Dorris  Haynes  or Premier  could not manage: of some two hundred American car makers in existence in 1920  only 43 survived in 1930  and with the Great Depression  by 1940  only 17 of those were left.[43]
30,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#bodyContent,In Europe  much the same would happen. Morris set up its production line at Cowley in 1924  and soon outsold Ford  while beginning in 1923 to follow Ford's practice of vertical integration  buying Hotchkiss (engines)  Wrigley (gearboxes)  and Osberton (radiators)  for instance  as well as competitors  such as Wolseley: in 1925  Morris had 41 per cent of total British car production. Most British small-car assemblers  from Abbey to Xtra  had gone under. Citroën did the same in France  coming to cars in 1919; between them and other cheap cars in reply such as Renault's 10CV and Peugeot's 5CV  they produced 550 000 cars in 1925  and Mors  Hurtu  and others could not compete.[43] Germany's first mass-manufactured car  the Opel 4PS Laubfrosch (Tree Frog)  came off the line at Rüsselsheim in 1924  soon making Opel the top car builder in Germany  with 37.5 per cent of the market.[43]
31,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#bodyContent,In Japan  car production was very limited before World War II. Only a handful of companies were producing vehicles in limited numbers  and these were small  three-wheeled for commercial uses  like Daihatsu  or were the result of partnering with European companies  like Isuzu building the Wolseley A-9 in 1922. Mitsubishi was also partnered with Fiat and built the Mitsubishi Model A based on a Fiat vehicle. Toyota  Nissan  Suzuki  Mazda  and Honda began as companies producing non-automotive products before the war  switching to car production during the 1950s. Kiichiro Toyoda's decision to take Toyoda Loom Works into automobile manufacturing would create what would eventually become Toyota Motor Corporation  the largest automobile manufacturer in the world. Subaru  meanwhile  was formed from a conglomerate of six companies who banded together as Fuji Heavy Industries  as a result of having been broken up under keiretsu legislation.
32,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#bodyContent,The transport sector is a major contributor to air pollution  noise pollution and climate change.[46]
33,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#bodyContent,Most cars in use in the early 2020s run on petrol burnt in an internal combustion engine (ICE). The International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers says that  in countries that mandate low sulphur motor spirit  petrol-fuelled cars built to late 2010s standards (such as Euro-6) emit very little local air pollution.[47][48] Some cities ban older petrol-driven cars and some countries plan to ban sales in future. However  some environmental groups say this phase-out of fossil fuel vehicles must be brought forwards to limit climate change. Production of petrol-fuelled cars peaked in 2017.[49][50]
34,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#bodyContent,Other hydrocarbon fossil fuels also burnt by deflagration (rather than detonation) in ICE cars include diesel  autogas  and CNG. Removal of fossil fuel subsidies [51][52] concerns about oil dependence  tightening environmental laws and restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions are propelling work on alternative power systems for cars. This includes hybrid vehicles  plug-in electric vehicles and hydrogen vehicles. Out of all cars sold in 2021  nine per cent were electric  and by the end of that year there were more than 16 million electric cars on the world's roads.[53] Despite rapid growth  less than two per cent of cars on the world's roads were fully electric and plug-in hybrid cars by the end of 2021.[53] Cars for racing or speed records have sometimes employed jet or rocket engines  but these are impractical for common use.
35,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#bodyContent,Oil consumption has increased rapidly in the 20th and 21st centuries because there are more cars; the 1980s oil glut even fuelled the sales of low-economy vehicles in OECD countries. The BRIC countries are adding to this consumption.
36,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#bodyContent,As of 2023[update] few production cars use wheel hub motors.[54][55]
37,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#bodyContent,In almost all hybrid (even mild hybrid) and pure electric cars regenerative braking recovers and returns to a battery some energy which would otherwise be wasted by friction brakes getting hot.[56] Although all cars must have friction brakes (front disc brakes and either disc or drum rear brakes[57]) for emergency stops  regenerative braking improves efficiency  particularly in city driving.[58]
38,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#bodyContent,Cars are equipped with controls used for driving  passenger comfort  and safety  normally operated by a combination of the use of feet and hands  and occasionally by voice on 21st-century cars. These controls include a steering wheel  pedals for operating the brakes and controlling the car's speed (and  in a manual transmission car  a clutch pedal)  a shift lever or stick for changing gears  and a number of buttons and dials for turning on lights  ventilation  and other functions. Modern cars' controls are now standardised  such as the location for the accelerator and brake  but this was not always the case. Controls are evolving in response to new technologies  for example  the electric car and the integration of mobile communications.
39,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#bodyContent,Some of the original controls are no longer required. For example  all cars once had controls for the choke valve  clutch  ignition timing  and a crank instead of an electric starter. However  new controls have also been added to vehicles  making them more complex. These include air conditioning  navigation systems  and in-car entertainment. Another trend is the replacement of physical knobs and switches by secondary controls with touchscreen controls such as BMW's iDrive and Ford's MyFord Touch. Another change is that while early cars' pedals were physically linked to the brake mechanism and throttle  in the early 2020s  cars have increasingly replaced these physical linkages with electronic controls.
40,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#bodyContent,Cars are typically equipped with interior lighting which can be toggled manually or be set to light up automatically with doors open  an entertainment system which originated from car radios  sideways windows which can be lowered or raised electrically (manually on earlier cars)  and one or multiple auxiliary power outlets for supplying portable appliances such as mobile phones  portable fridges  power inverters  and electrical air pumps from the on-board electrical system.[59][60][a] More costly upper-class and luxury cars are equipped with features earlier such as massage seats and collision avoidance systems.[61][62]
41,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#bodyContent,Dedicated automotive fuses and circuit breakers prevent damage from electrical overload.
42,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#bodyContent,Cars are typically fitted with multiple types of lights. These include headlights  which are used to illuminate the way ahead and make the car visible to other users  so that the vehicle can be used at night; in some jurisdictions  daytime running lights; red brake lights to indicate when the brakes are applied; amber turn signal lights to indicate the turn intentions of the driver; white-coloured reverse lights to illuminate the area behind the car (and indicate that the driver will be or is reversing); and on some vehicles  additional lights (e.g.  side marker lights) to increase the visibility of the car. Interior lights on the ceiling of the car are usually fitted for the driver and passengers. Some vehicles also have a boot light and  more rarely  an engine compartment light.
43,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#bodyContent,During the late 20th and early 21st century  cars increased in weight due to batteries [64] modern steel safety cages  anti-lock brakes  airbags  and more-powerful—if more efficient—engines[65] and  as of 2019[update]  typically weigh between 1 and 3 tonnes (1.1 and 3.3 short tons; 0.98 and 2.95 long tons).[66] Heavier cars are safer for the driver from a crash perspective  but more dangerous for other vehicles and road users.[65] The weight of a car influences fuel consumption and performance  with more weight resulting in increased fuel consumption and decreased performance. The Wuling Hongguang Mini EV  a typical city car  weighs about 700 kilograms (1 500 lb). Heavier cars include SUVs and extended-length SUVs like the Suburban. Cars have also become wider.[67]
44,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#bodyContent,Some places tax heavier cars more:[68] as well as improving pedestrian safety this can encourage manufacturers to use materials such as recycled aluminium instead of steel.[69] It has been suggested that one benefit of subsidising charging infrastructure is that cars can use lighter batteries.[70]
45,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#bodyContent,Most cars are designed to carry multiple occupants  often with four or five seats. Cars with five seats typically seat two passengers in the front and three in the rear. Full-size cars and large sport utility vehicles can often carry six  seven  or more occupants depending on the arrangement of the seats. On the other hand  sports cars are most often designed with only two seats. Utility vehicles like pickup trucks  combine seating with extra cargo or utility functionality. The differing needs for passenger capacity and their luggage or cargo space has resulted in the availability of a large variety of body styles to meet individual consumer requirements that include  among others  the sedan/saloon  hatchback  station wagon/estate  coupe  and minivan.
46,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#bodyContent,Traffic collisions are the largest cause of injury-related deaths worldwide.[10] Mary Ward became one of the first documented car fatalities in 1869 in Parsonstown  Ireland [71] and Henry Bliss one of the US's first pedestrian car casualties in 1899 in New York City.[72] There are now standard tests for safety in new cars  such as the Euro and US NCAP tests [73] and insurance-industry-backed tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS).[74]
47,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#bodyContent,The costs of car usage  which may include the cost of: acquiring the vehicle  repairs and auto maintenance  fuel  depreciation  driving time  parking fees  taxes  and insurance [9] are weighed against the cost of the alternatives  and the value of the benefits—perceived and real—of vehicle usage. The benefits may include on-demand transportation  mobility  independence  and convenience [11] and emergency power.[76] During the 1920s  cars had another benefit: [c]ouples finally had a way to head off on unchaperoned dates  plus they had a private space to snuggle up close at the end of the night.[77]
48,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#bodyContent,Similarly the costs to society of car use may include; maintaining roads  land use  air pollution  noise pollution  road congestion  public health  health care  and of disposing of the vehicle at the end of its life; and can be balanced against the value of the benefits to society that car use generates. Societal benefits may include: economy benefits  such as job and wealth creation  of car production and maintenance  transportation provision  society wellbeing derived from leisure and travel opportunities  and revenue generation from the tax opportunities. The ability of humans to move flexibly from place to place has far-reaching implications for the nature of societies.[12]
49,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#bodyContent,Cars are a major cause of urban air pollution [80] with all types of cars producing dust from brakes  tyres  and road wear [81] although these may be limited by vehicle emission standards.[82] While there are different ways to power cars  most rely on petrol or diesel  and they consume almost a quarter of world oil production as of 2019[update].[49] Both petrol and diesel cars pollute more than electric cars.[83] Cars and vans caused 8% of direct carbon dioxide emissions in 2021.[84] As of 2021[update]  due to greenhouse gases emitted during battery production  electric cars must be driven tens of thousands of kilometres before their lifecycle carbon emissions are less than fossil fuel cars;[85][86] however this varies considerably[87] and is expected to improve in future due to lower carbon electricity  and longer lasting batteries[88] produced in larger factories.[89] Many governments use fiscal policies  such as road tax  to discourage the purchase and use of more polluting cars;[90] and many cities are doing the same with low-emission zones.[91] Fuel taxes may act as an incentive for the production of more efficient  hence less polluting  car designs (e.g.  hybrid vehicles) and the development of alternative fuels.[citation needed] High fuel taxes or cultural change may provide a strong incentive for consumers to purchase lighter  smaller  more fuel-efficient cars [citation needed] or to not drive.[91]
50,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#bodyContent,The lifetime of a car built in the 2020s is expected to be about 16 years  or about 2 millionkm (1.2 millionmiles) if driven a lot.[92] According to the International Energy Agency the average rated fuel consumption of new light-duty vehicles fell by only 0.9% between 2017 and 2019  far smaller than the 1.8% annual average reduction between 2010 and 2015. Given slow progress to date  the IEA estimates fuel consumption will have to decrease by 4.3% per year on average from 2019 to 2030.[93] The increase in sales of SUVs is bad for fuel economy.[49] Many cities in Europe have banned older fossil fuel cars and all fossil fuel vehicles will be banned in Amsterdam from 2030.[94] Many Chinese cities limit licensing of fossil fuel cars [95] and many countries plan to stop selling them between 2025 and 2050.[96]
51,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#bodyContent,The manufacture of vehicles is resource intensive  and many manufacturers now report on the environmental performance of their factories  including energy usage  waste and water consumption.[97] Manufacturing each kWh of battery emits a similar amount of carbon as burning through one full tank of petrol.[98] The growth in popularity of the car allowed cities to sprawl  therefore encouraging more travel by car  resulting in inactivity and obesity  which in turn can lead to increased risk of a variety of diseases.[99]
52,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#bodyContent,Animals and plants are often negatively affected by cars via habitat destruction and pollution. Over the lifetime of the average car  the loss of habitat potential may be over 50 000 square metres (540 000 sq ft) based on primary production correlations.[100][clarification needed] Animals are also killed every year on roads by cars  referred to as roadkill. More recent road developments are including significant environmental mitigation in their designs  such as green bridges (designed to allow wildlife crossings) and creating wildlife corridors.
53,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#bodyContent,Growth in the popularity of cars and commuting has led to traffic congestion.[101] Moscow  Istanbul  Bogotá  Mexico City and São Paulo were the world's most congested cities in 2018 according to INRIX  a data analytics company.[102]
54,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#bodyContent,Mass production of personal motor vehicles in the United States and other developed countries with extensive territories such as Australia  Argentina  and France vastly increased individual and group mobility and greatly increased and expanded economic development in urban  suburban  exurban and rural areas.[citation needed]
55,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#bodyContent,In the United States  the transport divide and car dependency resulting from domination of car-based transport systems presents barriers to employment in low-income neighbourhoods [103] with many low-income individuals and families forced to run cars they cannot afford in order to maintain their income.[104] Dependency on automobiles by African Americans may result in exposure to the hazards of driving while black and other types of racial discrimination related to buying  financing and insuring them.[105]
56,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#bodyContent,Although intensive development of conventional battery electric vehicles is continuing into the 2020s [106] other car propulsion technologies that are under development include wireless charging [107] hydrogen cars [108] and hydrogen/electric hybrids.[109] Research into alternative forms of power includes using ammonia instead of hydrogen in fuel cells.[110]
57,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#bodyContent,New materials which may replace steel car bodies include aluminium [111] fiberglass  carbon fiber  biocomposites  and carbon nanotubes.[112] Telematics technology is allowing more and more people to share cars  on a pay-as-you-go basis  through car share and carpool schemes. Communication is also evolving due to connected car systems.[113]
58,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#bodyContent,Fully autonomous vehicles  also known as driverless cars  already exist as robotaxis[114][115] but have a long way to go before they are in general use.[116]
59,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#bodyContent,There have been several projects aiming to develop a car on the principles of open design  an approach to designing in which the plans for the machinery and systems are publicly shared  often without monetary compensation. None of the projects have succeeded in developing a car as a whole including both hardware and software  and no mass production ready open-source based designs have been introduced. Some car hacking through on-board diagnostics (OBD) has been done so far.[117]
60,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#bodyContent,Car-share arrangements and carpooling are also increasingly popular  in the US and Europe.[118] For example  in the US  some car-sharing services have experienced double-digit growth in revenue and membership growth between 2006 and 2007. Services like car sharing offer residents to share a vehicle rather than own a car in already congested neighbourhoods.[119]
61,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#bodyContent,The automotive industry designs  develops  manufactures  markets  and sells the world's motor vehicles  more than three-quarters of which are cars. In 2020  there were 56 million cars manufactured worldwide [120] down from 67 million the previous year.[121]
62,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#bodyContent,The automotive industry in China produces by far the most (20 million in 2020)  followed by Japan (seven million)  then Germany  South Korea and India.[122] The largest market is China  followed by the US.
63,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#bodyContent,Around the world  there are about a billion cars on the road;[123] they burn over a trillion litres (0.26×10^12 US gal; 0.22×10^12 imp gal) of petrol and diesel fuel yearly  consuming about 50 exajoules (14 000 TWh) of energy.[124] The numbers of cars are increasing rapidly in China and India.[13] In the opinion of some  urban transport systems based around the car have proved unsustainable  consuming excessive energy  affecting the health of populations  and delivering a declining level of service despite increasing investment. Many of these negative effects fall disproportionately on those social groups who are also least likely to own and drive cars.[125][126] The sustainable transport movement focuses on solutions to these problems. The car industry is also facing increasing competition from the public transport sector  as some people re-evaluate their private vehicle usage.
64,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#bodyContent,Established alternatives for some aspects of car use include public transport such as busses  trolleybusses  trains  subways  tramways  light rail  cycling  and walking. Bicycle sharing systems have been established in China and many European cities  including Copenhagen and Amsterdam. Similar programmes have been developed in large US cities.[127][128] Additional individual modes of transport  such as personal rapid transit could serve as an alternative to cars if they prove to be socially accepted.[129] A study which checked the costs and the benefits of introducing Low Traffic Neighbourhood in London found the benefits overpass the costs approximately by 100 times in the first 20 years and the difference is growing over time.[130]

This Privacy Policy explains how the Wikimedia Foundation  the non-profit organization that hosts the Wikimedia Sites  like Wikipedia  collects  uses  and shares information we receive from you through your use of the Wikimedia Sites. It is essential to understand that  by using any of the Wikimedia Sites  you consent to the collection  transfer  processing  storage  disclosure  and use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.

The page history will show when your contribution or deletion was made  as well as your username (if you are signed in) or your IP address (if you are not signed in). We may use your public contributions  either aggregated with the public contributions of others or individually  to create new features or data-related products for you or to learn more about how the Wikimedia Sites are used  as further explained below in the How We Use Information We Receive From You section of this Privacy Policy.

However  if you contribute without signing in  your contribution will be publicly attributed to the IP address associated with your device.
184,https://foundation.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Policy:Privacy_policy,If you want to create a standard account  in most cases we require only a username and a password. However  if you choose not to provide an email address  we cannot help you recover your password.
185,https://foundation.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Policy:Privacy_policy,Your username will be publicly visible  so please be careful about revealing your real name or other Personal Information in your username. Your password is only used to verify that the account is yours. Your IP address is also automatically submitted to us  and we record it temporarily. This is to protect Wikimedia users and project content; in the event of abuse  IP addresses may be associated with usernames as part of an investigation.

186,https://foundation.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Policy:Privacy_policy,Once created  user accounts cannot be removed entirely (although you can usually hide the information on your user page if you choose to). This is because your public contributions must be associated with their author (you!). In some circumstances  the Wikimedia communities can assist users with removing additional information related to their account from the projects.
187,https://foundation.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Policy:Privacy_policy,To gain a better understanding of the demographics of our users  to localize our services and to learn how we can improve our services  we may ask you for more demographic information  such as gender or age  about yourself. We will tell you if such information is intended to be public or private  so that you can make an informed decision about whether you want to provide us with that information. Providing such information is always completely optional. If you do not want to  you do not have to—it is as simple as that.

These various user-selected administrative groups have their own privacy and confidentiality guidelines  but all such groups are supposed to agree to follow our Access to nonpublic personal data policy. These user-selected administrative groups are accountable to other users through checks and balances: users are selected through a community-driven process and overseen by their peers through a logged history of their actions.

307,https://foundation.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Policy:Universal_Code_of_Conduct,This includes any behaviour intended primarily to intimidate  outrage or upset a person  or any behaviour where this would reasonably be considered the most likely main outcome. Behaviour can be considered harassment if it is beyond what a reasonable person would be expected to tolerate in a global  intercultural environment. Harassment often takes the form of emotional abuse  especially towards people who are in a vulnerable position  and may include contacting workplaces or friends and family members in an effort to intimidate or embarrass. In some cases  behaviour that would not rise to the level of harassment in a single case can become harassment through repetition. Harassment includes but is not limited to:
